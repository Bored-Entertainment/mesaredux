The original game is located [here](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/).
This version was forked from [aquaflame95's clone](https://github.com/AquaFlame95/aquaflame95.github.io), which was forked from [ozh's](https://github.com/ozh/cookieclicker). This game is made by none of the people listed here, except for Orteil and Opti who host the official webpage. 
This is for "educational" purposes.

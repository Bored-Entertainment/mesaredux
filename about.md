For those who've been following us, but even moreso for those who have not—MESλREDUX comes from a 2 year hiatus off our last project, mesa.rip—of which is a site that was developed 98% completely by harper. The MESλREDUX project was first created in early Februrary 2024 by greymesa, but due to irl commitments, it never ended up going much of anywhere. Fret not though, we're back for good!

#### MESλREDUX is developed by the following people:
- [greymesa](https://mesagrey.ca) - THE first member of the Bored Entertainment team, joining the Discord in 2019 and helped PiSaucer maintain BoredHTML. has worked on every Bored Entertaintment project, being the namesake of Mesa Complex (plus being its top contributer!) and working on about 90% of everything on this site. He enjoys collecting records and making sites (duh) in his free time!

- [pawlixy](#) - Joined the team in April 2021 with Duck, both of which developed Schoolgrounds. She went on to work on The Mesa Complex. Super duper awesome gamedev. 

- [The Duck](https://the-duck.co/) - He joined the team in April 2021 as well. Created Schoolgrounds with pawlixy, worked on a brunt of Mesa Complex. Also a super duper awesome gamedev

- [harper aka. cupofdirtfordinner](https://dirt.cool/) - Joined the team in Janurary 2022. Was one of the primary developers of Mesa Complex, singlehandidly made nearly all of mesa.rip. She makes awesome music, sites, and games.

- [swordslasher](https://swordslasher.com/) - Joined the team sometime in 2022. Created Slash Flash, yoinking like all of the games from BoredHTML. There used to be a longstanding joke among the team about how squeaky the guys voice was, but it's actually pretty normal now. He also is really into iPods!!

- [PiSaucer](https://bored.pisaucer.com/) - The man behind it all. Founded Bored Entertaintment way back in 2018 with BoredHTML, has contributed to every Bored Entertainment site up till Mesa Complex. Unfourtunately too busy with university to be active nowadays.

#### MESλREDUX could not be created without the following parties:
- [EGGRAMEN](https://eggramen.neocities.org/) - for the use of their HTML layout.

- [slash](https://slashist.straw.page/) - FOR SINGLEHANDIDLY MAKING OUR LOGOS FOR THIS SITE. WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT HER !!!!!

- [Bastiti](https://github.com/Bastiti) - for use of their Custom Discord Widget gist.

- [The Ruffle Team](https://ruffle.rs/) - for facilitating the preservation and playability of Flash games in current year.

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllcodex.org/) - for being the best Static Site Generator a guy could ask for. We might have a love-hate relationship, but that won't stop us from shoutting you out.

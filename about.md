## what i do (or used to do)

i used to be crazy down the cs kid pipeline in the 7th/8th grade. i practically planned my life around going to a good uni in a cs program. during the pandemic it got to the point where i would wake up, work on a project for the day while barely listening to the teacher on google meet, then sleep. needless to say it wasn't healthy in the slightest. after entering highschool, i realized that making friends and finding other hobbies is infinitely better than staying inside all day and doing compsci projects. 

nowadays I don't really have the time that I used to have to commit to webdev stuff. as a result, i'm guessing that this'll probably be the final iteration of this website.
